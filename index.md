## App Concept

### Use Case
Many people today lead pretty sedentary lifestyles, often not getting enough physical activity to maintain their health. The World Health Organization (WHO) lists physical inactivity as one of the leading risk factors for major health problems like heart disease and diabetes. Movemate aims to make it easier and more engaging for people to stay active and build healthier habits. By tracking steps and encouraging users to move more, Movemate helps boost overall health and well-being.

### Target Users
- **People with sedentary jobs** who want to increase their daily movement.
- **Individuals with fitness or weight loss goals** who need a tool to track progress.
- **Health-conscious users** seeking ways to improve their daily routines and stay active.

### Similar Apps
Movemate stands alongside other popular fitness apps, but with a unique twist:
- **Google Fit**
- **Pacer**
- **Fitbit**

While these apps provide excellent tracking features, Movemate goes beyond by incorporating gamification elements to keep users engaged and motivated.

### User Flow

### Gamification
We plan to add gamification features to make Movemate more fun and interactive. Instead of just showing your step count in a standard UI, Movemate introduces a **virtual pet** that thrives based on your activity:

- **Daily Goals:** Feed your virtual pet by hitting your daily step goal. Keep a streak of several days and you pet will become _buff_
- **Earning Coins:** Reach your goals to earn coins, which can be used to unlock new pets and customize your experience.
- **Long-Term Engagement:** This feature rewards consistent effort and makes staying active feel like a fun game instead of a chore.

With these features, Movemate turns step tracking into an engaging, goal-oriented experience.

## Usability Test Results

### **Key Findings from Qualitative Feedback**

### **Strengths:**

1. **Pet Feature Appeal:** Participants loved the idea of feeding virtual pets and described them as "cute" and engaging.
2. **Goal Setting:** Most users found the step goal feature straightforward and easy to use.
3. **Shopping Experience:** Participants reported that purchasing pets in the shop was intuitive and smooth.

### **Challenges Identified & Ideas**

1. **Calendar or Weekly Goals:** Some participants mentioned the lack of options for setting weekly goals or integrating with a calendar.
2. **Visual Guidance:** One participant suggested that additional visual cues or tooltips could make the pet feeding process clearer.
3. **Notification Feature:** Feedback suggested the inclusion of reminders or notifications for pet feeding and achieving step goals.
4. **New Pet Mechanics:** Introduced a feature where pets can become "angry" or even "disappear" if they are not fed for a prolonged period, encouraging consistent user engagement.
5. **Workout Mode:** Added a "Workout Mode" option where users can set time-based and step-based goals to earn extra coins as a reward for completing their workouts.

### **Updates Made Based on Feedback**

1. **UI Enhancements:** Improved Visual Design, especially colors
    

    
    Old Color Scheme
    
    
    Updated Color Scheme
    
2. **New Pet Mechanic:** If the users do not complete their step goals for some time, the pet will fall asleep and can only be awaken by walking a set amount of steps. The state of sleeping will last until the step goal is reached.
3. **Information Button:** Since a lot of test users did not know how the app worked, we added a button to display some information (e.g. on how to earn coins)

---

### **Conclusion**

Move Mate demonstrates strong usability with an above average SUS score of 76,56. There is definetely the possibility of a ceiling effect, since the SEQ scores where quite high. Since the app was made within two weeks and the app does not have the same amount of features as an app made by a big company. The tasks were quite easy, but we still got a lot of important insights and suggestions for improvement.
